# Gallerator

The gallery generator.

## Features

* Static gallery generation that can be used anywhere, also using `file://` urls
  without a web server.
* Create thumbnails for images and thumbnails and contact sheets for videos.
* Generates galleries in a few formats
  * Justified
  * Grid (two variants)
  * See Demos
* With or without thumbnail captions
* For a single directory or recursively for an entire tree
  * Includes navigation into sub-directories
* *ALL* filenames are relative, so you can move image and gallery files around
  and they still work, as long as they don't move relative to each other.
* Completely separate metadata generation and output rendering with a documented
  API between them
    * Two examples provided:
      * Renderer using [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) -
        the default and most full-featured.
      * Renderer using [nanogallery2](https://nanogallery2.nanostudio.org/) - I
        forgot to check nanogallery2's GPLv3 license when I wrote code for it.

## Installation and basic usage

```
# Need python 3.12:
$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.x (or higher)

# Perhaps use a virtualenv
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate

# Need ffmpeg - debian example
$ sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Install gallerator
$ pip3 install gallerator

# See command line flags
$ gallerator --help 

# Generator your first gallery
$ gallerator -g /path/to/gallery /path/to/images

# Profit - open the new gallery in your web browser
$ xdg-open file:///path/to/images
```

### Note on usage with NixOS

When using NixOS I've seen errors with libaries. `fix-python` is the solution
for that. So instead of the above for installation, do:

```
$ nix shell nixpkgs#{python312,libGL,ffmpeg,gcc} github:GuillaumeDesforges/fix-python
$ python -m venv venv --copies
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ fix-python --venv venv
$ pip3 install gallerator
# I don't remember exactly when I was required to run fix-python
$ fix-python --venv venv
$ gallerator -g /path/to/gallery /path/to/images
```

But if you're using NixOS, that is perhpas enough of a hint to get you started
(patches welcome).

## Customizations - about renderers

Generating output is and must be flexible. Users can write their own "renderer"
to generate `.html` file output. Two renderers come out of the box:

1. One using Photoswipe
2. One using nanogallery2

They basically just have to implement an instance of
`gallerator.renderer.Renderer` and return it as described under `gallerator
--help` for the `--renderer` flag. Look in the `renderer` folder for the two
examples if you want your own look and feel.

Both of the built-in ones use bootstrap, but they don't have to. You can use
whatever you like.

## Implementation details

### About the choice of slide-show-in-a-light-box library

At first I implemented this with
[nanogallery2](https://nanogallery2.nanostudio.org/) which has a simple API and
is quick to get started with. But the
[license](https://github.com/nanostudio-org/nanogallery2?tab=readme-ov-file#license--gplv3)
GPLv3! I didn't notice that when I picked it.

When [looking
for](https://github.com/search?q=gallery&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc)
popular open-source, non-GPL3 libraries for this, there seem to be two
contenders:

* [swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper) 40k stars
* [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) 24.3k stars

Others don't even come close (nanogallery2 has 762 stars).

I've tried to get swiper to [run in a
lightbox](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/discussions/4336#discussioncomment-11377361)
bit it looks like that is going to be a lot of work, so I picked PhotoSwipe. But
it is possible to writeother renderers

### About the naming of generated images

Currently, generated thumbnails are named:
`$gallery/generated-files/thumb-$sha1sum.jpg` where `$sha1sum` is the SHA1 sum
of the original source file.

This was done so that if you rename or move source images around, the thumbnails
still work. This may not be for everyone, and some may like something like
`$gallery/generated-files/path/to/file-thumb.jpg` instead. Not yet possible.

### Possible Enhancements

* Parallelize thumbnail generation, e.g. using `Pool.map()`.
  * Note that `vcsi` for generating video screenshots and contact sheets already
    has a `--fast` parameter that parallelizes under the hood so don't
    parallelize that. But we don't (yet) even use `--fast`.
  * More customizations
    * Page URL strategies: The naming of output `.html` files is currently
      hardcoded, but totally doen't have to. Look for
      `url_strategy.UnderscorePageUrlStrategy` in `gallery.py` and enable it
      instead, and you can see files are named differently. This just would need
      to be exposed in the CLI which it isn't (yet?). Patches welcome.
    * Allow flexible naming of thumbnails with or without SHA1 sums.
  * It would be great if generating screenshots and contact sheets for videos
    could be faster. Start with trying `vcsi --fast` ðŸ˜œ.
